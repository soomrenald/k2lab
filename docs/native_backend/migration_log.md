# Native backend migration log

## 2026-07-28 — Phase 0 / Gate 1 candidate

Branch: `feature/native-k2-backend`

Completed:

- read the native-backend migration specification in full;
- inventoried tracked desktop code and the exact pinned `k2core` source;
- searched direct ComfyUI/custom-node imports and indirect process, environment,
  filesystem, model-discovery and documentation assumptions;
- traced generation, image-edit and face-refinement calls from QML to the disposable
  ComfyUI worker;
- confirmed that this repository contains no RunPod entry point or deployment setup;
- proposed backend/service/module boundaries and immutable shared schemas;
- created the dependency inventory, parity matrix, test plan, risk register, known
  differences and rollback plan.
